## Audio_classification_CNN
Exploiting CNNs in order to classify audio excerpts of UrbanShound8K.
The project start from the preprocessing of audio exceprt into MFCC and subsequently design of CNNs structures.
Comparison of a ResNet50 vs a simpler CNN classifier.
Further hyperparametr tuning (via Optuna) of the simpler model, given that se obtain a comparable results in much faster training.
Visualization via optuna and Tensorboard
